# Overview

I decided to do this assignment because I have a good amount of experience with python but, I was learning aboubt data anlysis recenlty and thought that this would be a fun project to learn more about how I feel working on Data Analysis projects.

The data set I am analyszing is LinkedIN job postings (2023 - 2024). I got the data from a CSV file from the kaggle website, here is the link [LinkedIn Job Postings (2023 - 2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings?resource=download)

The prupose was to get data about the skills, salary, and location for popular job listings. Then once the data was gathered to format it into graphs to see the data in a simple way.
